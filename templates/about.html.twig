<p>
  Welcome to the MSK Data Catalog, a searchable and browsable online collection of records describing the contents of datasets and providing access instructions for those wishing to explore the data for their own research. As a user, the data catalog is designed to help you identify data resources that may inform your project or research question. Some data resources may be immediately available to you from the catalog. Others may require you to complete a data use application form or contact the data set owner to explore your options.
</p>
<p>
  The MSK data catalog is a digital way-finder designed to enhance discoverability and maximize the usefulness of datasets through rich metadata: description, keywords, data formats, instrumentation or software utilized in the creation of the data, and access information. It also connects researchers to data authors and experts to promote greater exposure and reuse of data while providing appropriate protections for authors. The Data Catalog is NOT a data repository to store data, but rather a portal to datasets stored in internal and external repositories. Our current inclusion criteria for this catalog are:
<ul>
  <li>Internal datasets created by MSK researchers and associated with publication(s),</li>
  <li>Internal datasets created by MSK researchers but not yet published or with no associated publication(s),</li>
  <li>External datasets referenced and used by MSK researchers in publication(s).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  If you are interested in submitting a dataset to the MSK Data Catalog, would like to suggest a data set for inclusion, or are willing to serve as a local expert, please contact us.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Highlights of the MSK Data Catalog:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Aggregate access to MSK datasets from one location,</li>
  <li>Identify access points, experts, or owners of MSK datasets,</li>
  <li>Help MSK researchers locate and understand datasets generated at external organizations,</li>
  <li>Facilitate both internal and external research collaborations,</li>
  <li>Increase the visibility of research data generated by MSK researchers and support data re-use,</li>
  <li>Enhance <a href="https://synapse.mskcc.org/">Synapse</a> records with data availability information.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  While the cataloged datasets represent MSK data, they do not include all publicly available, licensed, or private external datasets. If you would like assistance in conducting a more comprehensive search of all datasets accessible through the library, please contact us.
